## Express Tutorial Part 2: Creating a skeleton website
---
> This second article in our Express Tutorial shows how you can create a "skeleton" website project which you can then go on to populate with site-specific routes, templates/views, and database calls.

#### What view engine should I use?
> For this project, we'll use the Pug templating engine (this is the recently-renamed Jade engine), as this is one of the most popular Express/JavaScript templating languages and is supported out of the box by the generator.
#### What CSS stylesheet engine should I use?
> As with templating engines, you should use the stylesheet engine that will allow your team to be most productive. For this project, we'll use the ordinary CSS (the default) as our CSS requirements are not sufficiently complicated to justify using anything else.
#### What database should I use?
> The generated code doesn't use/include any databases. Express apps can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express itself doesn't define any specific additional behavior/requirements for database management).
> We'll discuss how to integrate with a database in a later article.
